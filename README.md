## Objectives

I created a Travel Bucketlist app with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM. Use Node and MySQL to query and route data in my app, and Handlebars to generate the HTML.


## Deploy Link

https://frozen-wildwood-92430.herokuapp.com/

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

```
$ git clone git@github.com:ayladillis/Travel-Bucketlist.git
ayladillis/Travel-Bucketlist.git
$ cd ayladillis/ayladillis/Travel-Bucketlist.git
```
Then open in your preferred text editor:
- [vim](https://www.vim.org/) 
- [emmacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/)
- [visual studio code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) 

## Code Highlight

Here, on lines 4- 15 I connected to the JAWSDB as well as my local host using create connection, then on lines 17 and 18 I connected to my Heroku.
